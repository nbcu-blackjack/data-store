How_Trump_Became_Trump_transcript
Before he was a presidential candidate I've been saying for years keep the oil keep the oil don't let up happy you know before he was a reality TV star if I Donald Trump was a New York tabloid fixture all through the nineteen eighties trump was busy building something new and it wasn't a skyscraper millionaire developer Donald Trump has put his name on a New York City hotels shopping center and apartment buildings is also casino in Atlantic city and now it's going to put his name on a big piece of it.. Was creating a public.. One that could be both funny and.. Arrogant and somehow in touch with the.. I sort of love and hate them at the same time I mean I think he has you know a monumental ego comes out being very.. Yeah.. I like.. Yeah I got.. Got it.. He often did this by picking fights.. Said I think Donald Trump is an artful wire I think he is a greedy vicious and arrogant.. Why does it supposed to be a compliment or not I'm I'm not sure he waged a years long battle with New York City mayor ed Koch I hope that in New York City has a different merit some point because I think I've got just a total disaster has been a very bad message and he helped launch a competitor to the NFL called the U. S. football league.. And then launched a lawsuit against the NFL when the USFL failed.. The jury in the case delivered its verdict it ruled the NFL did indeed monopolize pro football but get awarded damages of just one dollar.. And in one of his biggest fights of the nineteen eighties he went up against media mogul Merv Griffin in a fight over casino in Atlantic city people realize now that America made a bad deal.. It's unfortunate.. Love the.. Still you know.. Your latest.. I won I won I.. But he may.. Does he.. More than just.. Caller.. I'm more tax.. I learned in the eighties.. Today.. Guessing about any.. Trump what's left in your life for thirty three years old you're worth all this money you say you didn't.. Say that you.. Be worth a billion now I really don't.. A busy.. A billion dollars.. What do you think well I know money can't I know a lot of the politicians I like a lot of the politicians are friends of.. Trump carefully cultivated speculation about his future.. In nineteen eighty seven he ran a full page ad in major newspapers that read like a political manifesto.. A blow up of the ad is now on display at trump tower on Fifth Avenue the ad was irresistible to the New York press and the move kept trump's name in the news compost said quite seriously that he's a good enough bargainer to negotiate a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Russians.. This is not a wealthy country people think America you know well this and that the Japanese are saying what a wealthy country in the saying it now laughing countries losing two hundred billion dollars a year we ought to go in the next time they fire so much as a bullet in one of the ships we are going to take over their oil with each of these instances trump refined his playbook.. His attacks stood up to start pushing these people now little but because it's getting a little ridiculous as far as I'm concerned his boasts will probably sell extra ten thousand off season techniques and that's a lot of.. And his shifting positions do you have the the jeans.. To be a successful politician when you never really know I I think I'm pretty outspoken and that's not probably a good thing in terms of a politician but it's a good thing if you ever got elected you could really do a job now even back in the eighties many found trumps over the top personality distasteful what may be most discouraging a ball is at Palm Beach will accept almost anything that's got enough money.. But somehow it will not accept Donald Trump.. But by playing the role of an unpredictable bullied with the midas touch.. Trump showed he couldn't easily be ignored.. I believe that perhaps I'm portrayed differently than I I actually am.. I believe I'm portrayed in a rougher sense.. Then the actual product.. And I hope that's true because I hope the actual product is a lot more mellow than the portrayal and that may be his biggest asset of all when people attack trump may reinforce the version of trump that trump wants people to see.. And inevitably that keeps trump's name in the news.. That doesn't matter because I'm not running for office.. And B. C. news vans thanks for checking out our you tube channels..

Trump_Picks_Pence_for_VP_Transcript
I think what it does is it sends the message that that the professional political operatives in trump world wanted to send to the Republican Party which is that Donald Trump will will play a pragmatic politics when necessary this is a very pragmatic political pick for a nominee that is struggling to have his party United Mike pence is somebody that can campaign with any Republican in the country in any district Donald Trump is not going to be invited to campaign with every senator up for reelection that's a Republican but Mike pence is somebody they can't so it's a way of showing some leadership I have to say I am surprised in this respect because.. The most successful BP picks are those that seem to help anime or reinforce a larger message a larger meaning to your campaign what's amazing about this pic Savannah is that my pants represents everything Donald Trump ran against who right have both blades or conservative orthodoxy leadership long time people have been there and haven't solved these problems even on the issue disagreements as well and yet he went this direction I'll be curious to see how comfortable he is with pencils as running mate in two months NBC news fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel..

Mark_Cuban_on_Trump_HRC_and_Politics_Transcript
nd joining me now is untrue the entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks and owner of a lot of other things you've given Mr given welcome to meet the press thanks Chuck glad to be here …look last summer you called Donald Trump a great thing for politics.. Has this candidacy been good for the country.. All in some respects the on a longer term basis absolutely I think he's open the door to nontraditional armed candidates which is a great thing.. I think he's taken out the traditional you know arm bullet points and political speak that's a good thing but those a longer term issues in the short term there's a lot of divisiveness and a lot of uncertainty and that's not necessarily a good thing it's putting a lot of my interpretation of your comments on that was you know a couple years ago when so many ask about running for president I think your answer was I just know it was hell now.. …but I take it that what trump has done is made you feel comfortable about some day thinking about public services after effect would certainly more of a consideration that it was for the reasons you we've met before that you don't have to be the perfect arm Stepford candidate like you would have been in the past.. Look there's clearly a desire here for another alternative we've got a new poll out this …Sunday morning with a majority of voters in both sides feeling …negative feelings toward both of the potential nominees.. Why not run third party into the Libertarian Party still hasn't held their nominating convention it wouldn't take much for you to get that nomination if he went down there and your political views seem to fit more with them than any other party.. Yeah I mean I haven't really delved into the Libertarian Party to to know where they stand on not sure they'd want to bring somebody and that isn't quite a match with their views but on.. You know it's too late for that for this election and me just to try to wing it just to try to shake things up that you know the law of unintended consequences tends to create a lot more problems than it solves you know you're a big advocate of Michael Bloomberg running …you advocated in running I think you know eight and twelve and again in sixteen he chose not to because he said he didn't think he could win is that a good enough reason.. Yeah you're the person having to do all the work and drive through of course it is but is that good for the country.. Well again if your if your heart if you don't think you can win and then your decision making is impacted by that it's the same in sports at the same of politics.. The same in business if you don't think you're going to succeed I think voters in this case would would see right through it and see that that's the case.. So you can't you can't go into it not willing to do the work not willing to grind it so you know it's his choice to make.. Assess the Obama presidency.. I think he's done a lot of good things country to what some think I think he's made a lot of mistakes as well and and that's what you expect from a president I think he's smart I think he arm.. His his goal was to really bring up people from the bottom and providing healthcare that's been a positive step I think he's really had the interest of the country at heart but I think he's made since this.. Significant mistakes in foreign policy what's up obamacare meant to your business.. It really hasn't impacted my business is that all because we tend to it to have invested in health care for employees.. But I think from an entrepreneur's perspective it's given entrepreneurs the chance to leave job they were stuck in and get insurance where they'll demise otherwise might not have had it and really to me where it what it's accomplished either saying that but I live by a lot of my thinking it's called the rest doesn't lead to system.. And what happens is you know we might not have provided healthcare for as many people in the past.. Directly but we provided it indirectly on when you have to provide a cost indirectly it's always more expensive and so while we're having to pay more warm palm or insurance costs will pay more for medical costs lease were doing it up front release were trying to do it systematically because if we do it and people outside the system it's not like all the sudden they're healthy it's not like all the Sunday don't have medical needs and so we have to pay for them for our property taxes to other taxes and that's far less efficient and that's why I've been a proponent proponent of obamacare's all right let's go you just said …you were not happy with him on foreign policy can be specific on it you know what I'm not the guy who the foreign policy with kid to get into details I mean you know I think you're not happy I mean you know they're not you but yeah there's a difference between not being happy and not think it was it was a perfect implementation you know whether it's drawn that the bright line whether you know how we approach dealing with Syria whether it's you know whether or not we should have kept people land on Iraq longer on you know he's really try to to have an open mind in dealing with some.. It might not the right arm description.. I I think he's he's recognize that there's a lot of difficulties in foreign policy particularly in the Middle East particulars applies to terrorism and there's no right answer and I think he was searching to find solutions and because of that uncertainty because of that search them things happen that we didn't expect and that's great a lot of difficulties I may have done it differently but I'm not qualified to do again to give yours a a you know specific now one more thing I want to get in and you're and you're sort of potential political philosophy of sort.. You have …pretty interesting take on how to deal with student debt and you thought the government was actually helping to raise the cost without what had not lower explain okay a couple things one there there's.. When there's easy money if you look back at the real estate crisis and the the Great Recession of two thousand seven on the two thousand eight what caused it was easy money anybody could borrow money and go buy a house which raise picked the price of the house of housing and I got to the point where there is a bubble then the bubble burst when the easy money burst.. The same thing is happening with college tuition right now.. Anybody come borrow money there's a limit in what can be federally guaranteed for the student but there's no limit on how much a packing co sign for how much a parent can borrow for the student for theirs that their kids arm in order to pay for tuition and other costs and as a result of that it's been easy money for colleges which is meant they've been able to continue to raise tuitions.. And the money they brought and it's not like they're spending their encore things that improve a kid's education instead they're they're trying to improve the drive up appeal because there's so much competition for students so the spending on stadium just been in an on jams are spending that on you know restaurants to spend it on you know curbside appeal which doesn't really impact their education so my solution has been put a limit on the amount of money that a family can borrow per student if you limit that is to say thirty thousand dollars in total then the easy money has gone for colleges and to wish it will drop like a rock no if ands or buts about it alright you said you would tax the hell out of Wall Street explain what that means well when I said that right now there's.. I'm there's that issue right now for me with market structure I think word significant risk with high frequency trading because what's happening in the you know the ritual bowl of Wall Street was to be able to create a source of capital for companies to grow create liquidity and allow investors to invest.. But what we the vault to Dow with things like high frequency algorithmic trading but a particular high frequency trading is that where it's all about financial engineering it's not about investing in companies and watching them grow anymore and so we're seeing quotes transactions that happen in milliseconds that have nothing to do with investing and so if you put just a minuscule tax.. On each trade but possibly even a smaller on tax on each quote you're gonna see Wall Street you're gonna see markets gear back towards actual investments you sell Alberni Sanders by the way he's got a th.. Proposal a paper is pre college that essentially does what you're saying tax on transactions yeah it it won't work because you're going to see that won't happen because Hey you're gonna see the number of transactions decline and so the amount of revenue thinks he's going to get is not gonna matches expectation but that's not necessarily a bad thing and on the flipside his idea for paper free college tuition is delusional because that's even more easy money for the colleges which means are going to raise tuition even more and it's going to cost taxpayers even more Harlem let me go back to Clinton …versus trump here you joke that you would love to be Clinton's running mate as long as you were allowed …to throw bombs that trump.. Are you if she really did come to you.. Would you listen.. Absolutely arm but the key would be that you have to go more to center I think you know I like the fact that on senator Clinton has thought out proposals that's a good thing because at least we get to see exactly where she stands but I think senator standards has dragged a little bit too far to the left things like college tuition and you know other arm business elements that really I think it hurt the economy if she's willing to listen if she's willing to you know hear other other sides of things that I'm wide open to discussing what about Donald Trump.. Say you know I'm I'm an independent and out on fiercely independent and think for myself and I have the same conversation for Donald I think Donald has a real chance to win and that's scary to a lot of people but what's scary about it to me is that you can see him now trying to do what he thinks is right to unify the party and is listening to everybody which is fine on the surface but what's also happening is it's coming across as if.. He's proposing things based off the last person he talks to.. All you need to you know re unite the conservatives and hero eleven people to propose personally Supreme Court justice I bet you if you ask him about any one of them and to discuss any one of their own findings he would be able to do it and to me that's a problem and so if you ask me ideally okay Donald that's great let's talk about it but we're both going to have to do again and really look and understand the issue so we can so we can come up with solutions you know for you and I talked ten years ago one of the questions I might ask a bit about your temperament right there so it you know and people have seen mark Cuban ten years ago it was that guy yelling at officials you know the owner of the Mavericks get mad all this stuff.. You've just you've.. You've toned it down no absolutely not a cheap but you have and and Donald Trump some people say has never changed his temperament welcome first of all there's two sides right went out during the Mavericks game that's where I let loose that's why let out all my anxiety all my aggression and I'll still scream right but the other twenty three hours a day or twenty two hours a day this what you see now is always been my temperament and with Donald could be changed you know and it's possible for anybody to change but.. You know I just don't see evidence that he wants to change I think he I think he's trying to do what you think is the right he thinks is the right thing right now but there's just so much coming at him at once he's looking for shortcuts and this is just not a job with a short cuts what …what what would you …what would it take to convince you to run in a twenty twenty or twenty twenty four.. It's too early to tell I mean depending on what happened with you know whoever is elected dependent on what happens with the economy because the reality is there's so much uncertainty with the economy and neither candidate really as come up with.. Anything even relevant to the economy.. You know and so we have to see what happened we'd have to see you know if Congress still does nothing or they've managed to take steps and really have an impact but there's so many variables that I don't have the answers to I really can't tell you know in one final issue question your business guys I'm guessing you're probably eight …would call yourself a free trader.. Yes the rest of that day as you can see both parties are revolting against the idea of trade agreements lay blame them they sensually blame them in the cell and I've I've been all throughout critically the middle of the country geographically what do you say to those folks that a couple of things I believe that these trade agreements been badly economy let's start lining up the people who are in businesses that export products.. You know I think in that the state of Texas there's hundreds of billions of dollars in exports ship every year we live in a global economy the minute you start Messines with the dynamics the relationships between the economy's whether its currency whether it's trade agreements whether it's just that the tenor of conversations between China UK whoever it may be it's a very delicate balance that we that really had a lot of uncertainty associated with that.. You've got to be very careful in what I would do is I'd start lining up people who are in businesses that export.. Because not only are we not then all the sudden create jobs because we put tariffs on but on the flip side you're gonna start losing jobs you're gonna start losing exports you're gonna start impact in the currency you're gonna start impacting what the federal reserve is able to do you're gonna start impacting jobs in ways that help we're not certain about it so I would be very very careful you know maybe we can negotiate contracts better done deals better but the reality is in a global economy there's a very delicate balance and you just can't nilly make propositions and and expect.. You know that everything's just gonna get better I'll write out a question is this cabs warriors or thunder I I've already eliminated the raptors nah.. I you know I'm a I'm gonna take a little bit of a lobster launch on here and go with the thunder.. No well that's bad news for watching a band because..
