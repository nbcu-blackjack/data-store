From comedy to drama to action Ryan Reynolds is one ofHollywood's most versatile leading man he's proving that once again in his new movie it's called dead pool Brian good morning good to see good morning then I speak to our it's an R. rated movie accelerated X. men Marvel bang and earns every single moment of our it sure does yeah and any churchshould you know its …it since that movie that I've been trying to get made for eleven years so it's been a long journey but had to get made this way in the right way which is that I'm.. Sadly it offers well it did surprise me that it took so long to get themovie made because I watched it yesterday and I loved it is it the fact that it's a super hero movie that kids can't see is that what took so long I think so I mean look I'm I'm I'm not running for parents of the year but I mean I would I was a kid my dad took me to a greater or movies all the time and I'm just I'm I'm fine I think %HESITATION.. But look it yes it in order for dead pool to be done the right way it had to be this way it was a difficult decision to the studio and I understand that decision but now they're they could be happier the three based on theMarvel Comics character tell me about dental described him to me he's at he's at Mercer comes down terminal cancer is ahead of.. Funny odd sort of character and and that goes into …experimental program where they basically torture him stupid and at the other end he comes out horribly disfigured big given him Wolverine's healing factor in many slightly unhinged well a lot on it she's really on hates really on hitting very mad at.. He breaks the fourth wall he addresses the audience directly in the film he's he's he makes fun of Ryan Reynolds I mean there's all sorts of crazy bad gaps that this thing goes to the so so it since we're talking about a super hero yeah one of the big debates we have in our studio all the time as if you could have a super power sure what would it be Savannah comes up
