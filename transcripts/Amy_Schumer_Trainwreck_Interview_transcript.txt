All eyes are on comedian Amy Schumer she was just named one of time's one hundred most influential people and yet people talking at the gala with a ball would prefer to move toward Kanye west change to the fell at his feet Schumer's first feature film called train wreck will hit theaters this summer working alongside director Judd Apatow she wrote the screenplay play and as a leading role and we visited the set here in New York for an exclusive first look.. I think you buy dialed me no no I I value my fingers.. Her film may be called train wreck but don't let the title fool you because Amy Schumer is clearly at the top of her game.. Expectations are high she teams up with comedy kingmaker Judd Apatow.. The famed director with a roster of hit starring comedian Steve Carell Seth Rogan in Lena Dunham.. And as the story goes the movie came about in part because of the infamous LA traffic.. So the rumor is that he heard you on Howard Stern.. And decided there is something really funny here so is this another example yet another of Howard Stern making the planet a better place to live.. It definitely I'm the first woman to leave Howard Stern without regretting it.. Yeah totally that's the truth I it is true I was sitting in my car in traffic and I thought oh Amy's really warm and funny and …brutally honest and and to talk about her family her relationship issues and I thought oh I'd like to see …her in a movie and soon we all can see that movie Amy plays a commitment phobic writer who falls for sports doctor bill hater his best friend basketball superstar lebron James.. Amy says her role mimics her real life for me what happened the church let out early he has a style where you're in the middle of shooting.. And I take will be over or in the middle of a take he'll yell out.. Align.. Try it this way or how about this line is this funny OneNote review people do believe that what what.. How do you take to that as someone who has home the standup craft so well over such a long period of time.. It's like a security blanket that.. It is like unfair to get to have and it's really get it I'm spoiled by it hopefully I'll work again and they'll be like why is no one giving the idea like I don't have to have my own idea.. Those ideas now being called fresh smart and new have been honed on the comedy circuit for nearly a decade the thirty three year old native New Yorker has a show on Comedy Central inside Amy Schumer one of the network's biggest hits which recently picked up a Peabody and the fourth season.. White hot right now some say her fame could eclipse her cousins longtime New York senator Chuck Schumer but it's safe to say her act would raise eyebrows in the halls of Congress she's been dubbed the sex comic bookish searing satiric comedy tackling sensitive issues what is the girl said yes but then she changes her mind out of nowhere like a crazy person got stop.. She's a proud feminist comic who holds back nothing you have been called.. Hilariously dirty.. Do you accept my parents separate a little …issue.. She does she's really she's dirty I brought my daughter to …the comedy cellar to …to see Amy and I had forgotten the content of Amy's act and let's just say my daughter learned.. Yeah yeah about it's we came early …you don't honestly it when people say that I am dirtier talk about sex a lot like I don't feel like I talk about it any more than is normal and I think because I am I …woman that.. People notice it more I think.. You know I'll get up and in a fifteen minute set have one joke about sex sometimes with their still a gun the sex comic but do you know that a guy will come up and like literally take his out onstage in there like you thinker let's give them a show …but I don't feel dirty I'm just talking about my truth and just imagine if that even has a shot at making it all morning probably does yeah and I think that you ask.. I like to say I don't remember seeing you only do one dirty Jocasta well when you're there in your kitchen I wanna show them what I want to show it off of it.. And we gonna talk to those other stars of train wreck tomorrow bill hater and lebron James and the movie from our sister company universal pictures will be released on July seventh two.. Economic huge fan Amy Schumer is sick I don't know.. Which to her point I wonder how much of it in there a girl count birthday beat a content cal anyway she's the star..
