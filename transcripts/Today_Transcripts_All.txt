This is about empowerment empowerment of women prove fashion how do you describe.. A sense of empowerment in your own life.. I think.. I think it taking away the obstacle of.. How to dress.. It is a huge part of empowerment if you.. Feel smart you feel sexy.. But then you go to get dressed and and you just don't have a sale this time but some I don't have that chip where I know how to dress I think some women have it and some don't but that doesn't mean that I.. I batter wrong it just means.. But I need some help with that and so once I mean I know.. That I don't even think about my clothes.. I feel like there's nothing.. Holding you back there's nothing stopping me if I don't even have to think about.. I know I just feel good and not that's taken care of and that's that's.. What we want to hand people.. So did you talk out there about feeling confident yourself in there when you go to put on your clothes are you when you went shopping you lost all your confidence because you didn't feel like your body fat or you fat and that that transferred to not only did you close not fair but you weren't lovable you did have any worth and you were like a piece of.. A piece of yeah well yeah I mean is it really that.. Gimme bits of emotional thing it's it's been out a struggle for me my whole life and especially just.. Being in %HESITATION.. The entertainment industry being standing on a stage in front of people.. I can perform my or be confident if I'm not sure if I'm pulling it something and I just didn't know how to dress for I sometimes I'm a size six sometimes I'm a size twelve and.. So.. Going to put chains on are things that I see a girl in magazines and TV wearing.. Wasn't it green with.. My body type and it was and I felt you feel bad and then wrong in.. You're in a dressing room trying stuff on it maybe there's a sales girl who's like given looking area and then a lot of fittings I would have.. For for jobs like batter you know TV shows assuming and styles is busy and they're still annoyed and and you feel like they hate you because you're not railfan.. And and it it's it's creates so much anxiety ends and I sometimes I just wanna dislike and throw in the towel and if I'm not gonna go do stand up tonight or I'm not going on this job interview because.. I don't feel like I I look good and it's too stressful to try to piece together something.. To step out into the world and.. Which is why her you know for male comics I just look at them link.. Only you have not you didn't roll out of bed and go on stage and I have to lay.. So.. Lisa giving you these tools telling me how I can dress easily and comfortably.. And so I don't have to think about what I'm wearing because I don't think we only to be fashionistas.. To feel confident could only give a cool outfit so you said you didn't really have these tools to feel confident yet even though you are doing extremely well you're pretty big professional success until you met her yeah and so you guys haven't known each other that long so you just met first train wreck right yeah so like.. This feeling of confidence of the power that is a recent yeah.. Absolutely it was.. I was dressing enough I will dressing really really poorly and I don't even mean financially I would just.. He's super comfortable and wear something out.. That.. Just kind of.. Wanting to hide and that is all I notice.. Yeah and that that was me sending a message to myself.. %HESITATION.. You know.. The.. Your your value lays other places so you know not to worry about that and if people look at you and judge you for not addressing while living that's on them but it was just a defenseman.. Because I just didn't know how to put myself together and and also these feelings with other stylus.. Pretty shows or whatever it would be.. They would.. They would just put you in something and they would really care and they were like um okay that's good enough you know because I have other things to do.. Or.. You know did you gain weight or you know just the things that are really decimating.. And Lisa was the first one who.. Was like okay ever sizes and and the way things.. Just come off the hanger doesn't usually look its best.. Some tailoring and and I said this to the women there but.. This is not you don't need to be rich.. Two I.. You know I've I've.. Never even had a relative to ask a hundred dollars.. Eight from you know it and I just in the last couple years.. Start being able to afford.. A cool outfit.. But.. Lisa shops for me at forever twenty one.. Origin and it doesn't need to be expect.. Stuff.. To.. I feel great.. Talk to me about the moment.. Where you felt.. She understood.. Who you are.. What you had been going through.. And.. It was different.. Because that's what you're trying to convey with these workshops you're trying to give the women that you were talking to their the same moment yeah.. Yeah it it was such a gift.. Given.. To learn how to dress to feel.. Good about myself.. And that's the gift that we want to give.. Everyone.. Everywhere.. For me I.. It was the first thing I had lately so I was a surprise and there you know we were there parts of yourself you don't know me should accentuating I never had any real pride for any of my any body part and she's like you can wear skirts under this link then all of a sudden I'm like.. Hello.. All cool I I I've never had confidence in my legs or.. My neck or you know just some thing that you want to accentuate and.. And and it was just I was bracing myself to be.. %HESITATION.. It's it to feel that I was bracing myself to leave the fitting as I've left everything feeling bad about myself.. And it was just the opposite I was excited as excited about clothing.. But the big moment the big breakthrough moment.. Was I.. I'm very close to my sister.. And.. Lisa.. Dress her also.. Well I couldn't so my sister and I we both have always stressed.. Badly if I mean she'll she loves her shirt that says Harry potter at Harry potter but it's an honor and show where this into a meeting with.. I have HBO or mere minutes she doesn't care.. And I I you know.. So and I have a version of that too.. So Lisa given me this gift of showing you how to dress and feel good.. And she didn't have to do this but she just had to shop for my sister also and see my little sister where a little blazer and a shirt and looking just like a strong beautiful woman.. It was I realize that I'm holding myself back was also holding her back.. And so to see just the person I care the most about.. Being given us tools was really.. Moving for me and I just wanted to give it to every woman.. And there's just no yeah.. Feeling strong and beautiful and not being told that her body type this is wrong and.. Her face is bad it's.. I want everyone to be able to look in the mirror and feel great.. Did you not know that yeah looks lovely.. But what I think what you are also saying up there is you know this is not about money.. Because I think for so many people fashion it's without out of their reach they can't quote a four day right could never for you right and or afford what they think will make them look good so why is it important to do this with good well to do it for women out who can't afford.. I think because.. A good well is …a place that's very generously donated all of these clothes good well has this incredible …program where these women are going through counseling and they themselves are ready to move out into the world with confidence to get a great job and to succeed in life and I think %HESITATION.. That I really wanted to to make sure that I.. That feeling confident and feeling great and life wasn't just for any particular group based on if you can afford clothing.. That made you feel confident or not but that it was.. It was for everyone.. Because when you think about it when you have on a great outfit and you could have a great day feel good about yourself that day you create all these positive connections and the connections can be work connection between personal connections.. And it enhances your life.. And I just thought to myself you know why it.. What could happen.. If the majority of all the people walked around the world feeling.. Pretty good about themselves and were afraid.. You know to.. Step out and get that great job and and live that life that they want it but how do you what makes these women feel like you get it.. You get where they are in their life.. That there's not that much that separates you from.. Is that important TIA definitely I think if I'm.. If I'm.. Looking at somebody think well what.. She probably lives in like a mansion and just has a closet full of.. Amazing clothing and doesn't think about it and.. I.. You know I I've worked since I'm fourteen and.. I have.. Never known how to dress and had job interviews and additions and had to go to working on stage even to just do an open Mike in.. Yeah I've been.. Going to just try to wait tables somewhere and try to come up with that outfit and if you don't feel good and it it it's what you're thinking about you just can't you're thinking they're looking at me and they know that.. That I'm not just one this is not flattering to my body and.. I I just feel like all women have been there it doesn't matter if you're a rich supermodel.. Honestly or or someone just trying to join the with the work force.. I think it's you know I I think it's universal I think.. That we all regardless of our size or our economic level we all have moments of feeling insecure.. And that's that's a common thread that we can connect to each other with.. And I understand when someone doesn't feel good about what they're wearing and and they just start to slowly turn into hide and then suddenly see someone who feels great about what they're wearing and it's like.. You know standing up tall and smiling and.. That that really is is.. Is regardless of of where you come from and.. And what you can afford.. And it's.. You said something in an interview that I read where you said that tell you didn't take the daily show because you like to be scared you want to do things that scare you.. Does this scare you actually coming here to talk to these women about your own misgivings about fashion does talking about body type talking about feeling vulnerable is this scary and hence good.. It's.. It's not scary it's really exciting and.. I.. I I think we're both really well suited for it I'm not someone who pretends to be any cooler than they are and so I know I'm I know my aunt I know our intentions.. Are.. Just to.. Make these women.. Feel comfortable in their clothing so that they can just go out into the world and kick .. That that that.. That won't be something that's holding them back and I know that's my intention.. And I know we have the tools to help them do that and.. And so now I'm I'm not scared I'm.. I I couldn't wait to get in that room why.. Because it's it's my favorite thing to do it's.. I do.. I do stand up.. I'm doing these you know right now must towards twenty thousand seat theaters.. And it's half men half women and I'm so happy to be.. Doing and I'm so happy they're both there and I love making everyone laugh but.. But I'm speaking.. To the women I want I want the women to leave their feeling a little more empowered and.. And I know how much this empowered me and so.. I know that this is a a gift that will be able to give them.. And it's just totally exciting.. Is it do you think it's like %HESITATION.. Do you perform differently because of this experience because of this connection because of what you learned because the gift of Lisa to your sister the whole thing do you stand up differently yeah oh absolutely just move it really it it you know if if you just think about you like.. It's an outfit who cares but.. I'm telling you it was such a defense mechanism for me.. And it it just.. You know if you want a job interview you a meeting.. If if you're not just well I mean you just know that and by not just well I just mean.. It would be for your body type for.. %HESITATION.. Just right for yourself.. It just.. It creates.. Sort of shield for me where I would be.. Talking to executives of pitching it to the shower.. Or you know even just meeting friends for drinks are meeting new people and it just it made me a little me defensive and.. And I just want to kind of take myself out the equation as a as a woman just.. Don't you don't even look at me I'm not even trying.. I'm not because I don't care.. And that was my defenseman.. And I did realize that I was in pain about it and.. That I could just feel great and and put my absolute best.. Put forward.. And perform better.. And that's that's what it does what it did for me I.. I feel more open as a person and I feel just.. Stronger.. And I don't know I was able to perform better in all areas.. So what do you think when you hear that.. Pearls with a.. So now that I am hope someone feel more confident in their life is.. I can't think of anything better truthfully and you know honestly I have gone through my own struggles with my body image because.. I was …already a stylist in a costume designer.. For ten plus years and I developed a fire at a show and suddenly fifty pounds I was heavier than I had been before and I had to plan a new way to dress myself.. And feel comfortable in my own skin and and.. Step out and being great at the job that I had always loved.. Because you know I go to work and people expect me to be well dressed Thomas stylists and and I I had to navigate baton and find you know I know what made me feel good fifty pounds last but what makes me feel good now.. And how am I going to.. Feel confident continued this this message …died.. Confidence is more attractive than any item of clothing or any you know outfit how can I do that if I don't feel it.. You know one of the women in their ask …about.. How do you dress without being too overtly sexual.. When you said that you think that's actually a pretty common.. Feeling a motion that women have that you meet whether you're making a very good well or whether you're meeting Amy Schumer so we didn't you want this woman right here who wasn't leading kind who was talking a lot about sex but not leading.. Feeling like oh on sexual without it thing like you were saying she made you conscious awake at that blacks.. Yeah I was watching train wreck I think is good black.. I agree.. I think I want everyone to feel comfortable with saying I feel sexy and as a result of that you note understanding why.. And that that is something to be proud of and it's something that's about how we feel deeply in our core and non it %HESITATION.. A short skirt.. Short skirt is.. Is something about that affectation of.. Of being sexy feeling sexy is a state of panic.. And am finding clothing and I.. Who died makes that statement true.. Is really wonderful to watch because I confess I watch Amy.. You know.. Put on clothes and say yeah I feel great.. And I know that that she is like.. Same great because she feels sexy beautiful confident strong and able to go and do whatever it is that she is going to do that day whether it's a meeting or stand up or.. Just taking a walk on the other street park on the street and also Lisa really.. Just exposed me to the concept though crazy concept of what if you were just comfortable in the skinnier and what if you're not.. This is a temporary vessel that's in I'm good but when I lose that five there was always this okay I am not worth looking at now but I I'm striving in so this.. What about.. No.. This can happen right now.. I'm going to embrace and love it and I think.. Course you to be healthy and take care so I love working out and.. And everything like that but.. It's not this …if I can't stand it because.. You know you I owe you look at a picture yourself.. A year ago so hot that and why did I appreciate that now I'm a monster you know it's like I think we all have that weird so I'm like.. Let me appreciate this moment right now how I feel.. And where I am and not.. And that's why it in my mom at Saturday Night Live a.. Talk about the Kardashians and I think that and I I really like that family and I think that those girls are inspiring.. And they make me laugh I like them.. But the idea of.. Of not always pushing so hard and having it be about how you look and wanting to alter something to try to become this perfect.. Women are thing.. And because they're so.. You know.. Had heavily in the media there a lot of love for a lot of women that's their their role model and so.. It's really exciting for me to be in a position.. To say what about loving yourself how you are and not not a chance right not enhance what about just.. Saying that this is how I look and I'm.. I'm beautiful and I feel strong and.. You know on the internet people write about me they'll be like.. She is the most disgusting creature I've ever seen and I'm a and then other people say she's super hot and they're both right you're not going to be.. You're not going to be what everybody loves.. But you have to love.. Yourself.. And just making the decision to do that is something you can actually do and I think this is a good way to encourage women to do that are you saying though that you because you come across in your work excel confident yeah right you're whether you're like talking about gun control you're talking about sac yeah talking about men and women and there's nothing that seems to be off the table yeah.. And yet you're saying that before you met harden.. That was an act or not that was like it was my fault awful about myself all the time as well that I still felt sexy and strong and like my opinion really mattered.. And if I was doing a special on television or something I would have some help figuring out what to wear.. But I.. I would get dressed and I really wouldn't like what I saw and I didn't know what I was doing you know how to make the outside mir the hidden inside yeah you were feeling was not being portrayed to the world totally and that same way.. And.. With.. With Lisa's hope it was.. It was like here look this is still you you're comfortable you're not wearing a corset and spanks.. Except once in awhile and it it's yours I felt more like myself.. And.. Yeah I I wasn't working with herbal self esteem.. Or anything like that but I just thought that those painful moments of try to get dressed or try to buy something and I just don't have the version of the tools to know how to do that so you're talking to a lot of women here and you're talking about empowerment and you're talking about it through fashion.. Well but really empowerments.. Got to be in here right we gotta have the confidence of both of you come across up there like confident women.. What would you say are the two or three most important things you want these women to know about self confidence about thinking your opinion matters.. Thinking that you deserve to have one.. In the first place.. I really want them to know first of all you're not alone.. And.. Even.. Someone who.. Is successful and beautiful and it like a model those couldn't they have the same moments that these women have.. And that anxiety so they're not alone these are your struggles around us are not bad or wrong your body type isn't wrong.. You just haven't been given these tools.. And that's what tool do you want them to get take away from here that they can have your confidence that they can learn how to dress I get that right but you want also to quote empower them yeah I think where you get that where do you get that from.. Well that did the tips of the tools at least those.. Stylists are helping with and understanding what items they can buy out like a strawberry or thrift store I think it's all about shape that's really the truth inside once you find the shapes.. That you can recognize that make you feel good you can take those shapes and and repeat them daily.. So for instance if you know a narrow pant.. Feels good on you.. And a pencil skirt feels good on you.. Yeah you would.. Pair that with a top.. That also feels good like for me I like a knee length skirt I like a top that's fit in but not tight.. I started to realize that maybe feel that getting dressed with effortless when I put on those shapes and then those shapes.. Turn into the silhouette that becomes your daily uniform and if we can help women recognize the shapes.. That make them feel good.. Dot those shapes will be the go to every day and they're starts to be a lot less.. %HESITATION.. Affectation of of how fashion and how do I do it and what's the thought they know what to look for them they will look for their shape in their daily uniform so it's your hope that once they get the shape.. Once they feel good through the fashion they will in turn carry themselves.. Differently like you learned from park challenge your inside yeah.. Absolutely and just making.. Just giving them to the simple.. Information in a way that is an overwhelming that they can take home and tell their friends about.. No plea their frontal tell their friends and.. And.. Not even up to worry about their clothing and have that part be done because I really does wind up being such as.. Trustful it's very stressful and I think also you know when I'm tearing phones I might trust the character specific way to feel awkward to feel vulnerable and then I might drive someone to feel strong and confident and you really can see it in the body language and when you try things on if you can ask yourself this question there.. Do I feel confident do I feel strong and the answer to that is yes.. Those are the kinds of things you want to learn to repeat and regardless what's in fashion those of the shapes that work for you that's what makes you feel good and then people are suddenly like you look great.. And then maybe second or third thing they mention to you ends all and I love your outfit.. Yeah I love your outfit should never be the first thing that someone says I don't think.. When they see it go.. You know just think you look great.. Finally you have this big H. B. O. special what are you hoping you've had such a gang buster year first time on Saturday Night Live successful well speaking out on issues that matter to you vanatter in the country on gun control what are you hoping that this HBO special does.. Well I think.. Views style fun in the special actually go hand in hand because it's the specials me saying okay I just.. …got kind of thrust into Hollywood and who needs this is my experience of it and a lot of it is about self esteem and everything we're seeing in magazines and all the images we see on television and these people that were.. This is image area just really gets in your head and.. And how makes you feel about yourself I feel like I kind of went underground like I was doing.. %HESITATION.. Story on.. Hollywood I like I'm coming out like okay.. Here's what's going on.. No one's just naturally thin everyone starving.. And this telling all things I found out and that in a way that hopefully will …make everybody laugh and feel better which is Michael across the board.. But everything so you're like pulling the curtain back behind Hollywood insane it's not what you think you guys..

And decided there is something really funny here so is this another example yet another of Howard Stern making the planet a better place to live.. It definitely I'm the first woman to leave Howard Stern without regretting it.. Yeah totally that's the truth I it is true I was sitting in my car in traffic and I thought oh Amy's really warm and funny and …brutally honest and and to talk about her family her relationship issues and I thought oh I'd like to see …her in a movie and soon we all can see that movie Amy plays a commitment phobic writer who falls for sports doctor bill hater his best friend basketball superstar lebron James.. Amy says her role mimics her real life for me what happened the church let out early he has a style where you're in the middle of shooting.. And I take will be over or in the middle of a take he'll yell out.. Align.. Try it this way or how about this line is this funny OneNote review people do believe that what what.. How do you take to that as someone who has home the standup craft so well over such a long period of time.. It's like a security blanket that.. It is like unfair to get to have and it's really get it I'm spoiled by it hopefully I'll work again and they'll be like why is no one giving the idea like I don't have to have my own idea.. Those ideas now being called fresh smart and new have been honed on the comedy circuit for nearly a decade the thirty three year old native New Yorker has a show on Comedy Central inside Amy Schumer one of the network's biggest hits which recently picked up a Peabody and the fourth season.. White hot right now some say her fame could eclipse her cousins longtime New York senator Chuck Schumer but it's safe to say her act would raise eyebrows in the halls of Congress she's been dubbed the sex comic bookish searing satiric comedy tackling sensitive issues what is the girl said yes but then she changes her mind out of nowhere like a crazy person got stop.. She's a proud feminist comic who holds back nothing you have been called.. Hilariously dirty.. Do you accept my parents separate a little …issue.. She does she's really she's dirty I brought my daughter to …the comedy cellar to …to see Amy and I had forgotten the content of Amy's act and let's just say my daughter learned.. Yeah yeah about it's we came early …you don't honestly it when people say that I am dirtier talk about sex a lot like I don't feel like I talk about it any more than is normal and I think because I am I …woman that.. People notice it more I think.. You know I'll get up and in a fifteen minute set have one joke about sex sometimes with their still a gun the sex comic but do you know that a guy will come up and like literally take his out onstage in there like you thinker let's give them a show …but I don't feel dirty I'm just talking about my truth and just imagine if that even has a shot at making it all morning probably does yeah and I think that you ask.. I like to say I don't remember seeing you only do one dirty Jocasta well when you're there in your kitchen I wanna show them what I want to show it off of it.. And we gonna talk to those other stars of train wreck tomorrow bill hater and lebron James and the movie from our sister company universal pictures will be released on July seventh two..
