Before he was a presidential candidate I've been saying for years keep the oil keep the oil don't let up happy you know before he was a reality TV star if I Donald Trump was a New York tabloid fixture all through the nineteen eighties trump was busy building something new and it wasn't a skyscraper millionaire developer Donald Trump has put his name on a New York City hotels shopping center and apartment buildings is also casino in Atlantic city and now it's going to put his name on a big piece of it.. Was creating a public.. One that could be both funny and.. Arrogant and somehow in touch with the.. I sort of love and hate them at the same time I mean I think he has you know a monumental ego comes out being very.. Yeah.. I like.. Yeah I got.. Got it.. He often did this by picking fights.. Said I think Donald Trump is an artful wire I think he is a greedy vicious and arrogant.. Why does it supposed to be a compliment or not I'm I'm not sure he waged a years long battle with New York City mayor ed Koch I hope that in New York City has a different merit some point because I think I've got just a total disaster has been a very bad message and he helped launch a competitor to the NFL called the U. S. football league.. And then launched a lawsuit against the NFL when the USFL failed.. The jury in the case delivered its verdict it ruled the NFL did indeed monopolize pro football but get awarded damages of just one dollar.. And in one of his biggest fights of the nineteen eighties he went up against media mogul Merv Griffin in a fight over casino in Atlantic city people realize now that America made a bad deal.. It's unfortunate.. Love the.. Still you know.. Your latest.. I won I won I.. But he may.. Does he.. More than just.. Caller.. I'm more tax.. I learned in the eighties.. Today.. Guessing about any.. Trump what's left in your life for thirty three years old you're worth all this money you say you didn't.. Say that you.. Be worth a billion now I really don't.. A busy.. A billion dollars.. What do you think well I know money can't I know a lot of the politicians I like a lot of the politicians are friends of.. Trump carefully cultivated speculation about his future.. In nineteen eighty seven he ran a full page ad in major newspapers that read like a political manifesto.. A blow up of the ad is now on display at trump tower on Fifth Avenue the ad was irresistible to the New York press and the move kept trump's name in the news compost said quite seriously that he's a good enough bargainer to negotiate a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Russians.. This is not a wealthy country people think America you know well this and that the Japanese are saying what a wealthy country in the saying it now laughing countries losing two hundred billion dollars a year we ought to go in the next time they fire so much as a bullet in one of the ships we are going to take over their oil with each of these instances trump refined his playbook.. His attacks stood up to start pushing these people now little but because it's getting a little ridiculous as far as I'm concerned his boasts will probably sell extra ten thousand off season techniques and that's a lot of.. And his shifting positions do you have the the jeans.. To be a successful politician when you never really know I I think I'm pretty outspoken and that's not probably a good thing in terms of a politician but it's a good thing if you ever got elected you could really do a job now even back in the eighties many found trumps over the top personality distasteful what may be most discouraging a ball is at Palm Beach will accept almost anything that's got enough money.. But somehow it will not accept Donald Trump.. But by playing the role of an unpredictable bullied with the midas touch.. Trump showed he couldn't easily be ignored.. I believe that perhaps I'm portrayed differently than I I actually am.. I believe I'm portrayed in a rougher sense.. Then the actual product.. And I hope that's true because I hope the actual product is a lot more mellow than the portrayal and that may be his biggest asset of all when people attack trump may reinforce the version of trump that trump wants people to see.. And inevitably that keeps trump's name in the news.. That doesn't matter because I'm not running for office.. And B. C. news vans thanks for checking out our you tube channels..
